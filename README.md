Django Middlewares to aide your HubSpot Marketplace development efforts

AuthMiddleware
--------------
A middleware that ensures the marketplace requests are actually coming from the
marketplace.  It also adds a nice wrapper around the deluge of information
added to the requests.

MockMiddleware
--------------
A middleware that mocks out the marketplace functionality.  This ensures that
your local environment sees the same requets that your production environment
sees.  i.e. it allows you to develop locally -- fast!
